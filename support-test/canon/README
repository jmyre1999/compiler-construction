This package unfortunately depends on a package called 'temp' and
requires specific classes in order to compile.  The package 'temp'
is not provided to students and does evolve as the compiler progresses.

The requirements of package 'canon' are:

temp.Temp ()               no-argument constructor which generates a unique "temp"
temp.Label (String name)   a constructor which generates a unique "label"; the
                           string is presumable used in the label to help debug
                           IR code.

This package has been heavily modified from the original from Appel's book.
