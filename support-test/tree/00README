It use to be that this package depended on a package called 'temp' and
required specific classes in order to compile.  The package 'temp' was
not provided to students and does evolve as the compiler progresses.

The package 'tree' depended on the class: temp.Temp and temp.Label.

The class TreePrint no longer depends on temp.TempMap (an interface) and
temp.DefaultMap.  But it does depend on temp.Tem.


Overview of the structure of the package 'tree':

abstract class Exp
  class CONST (int value)
  class NAME  (temp.Label label)
  class TEMP  (temp.Temp temp)
  class BINOP (int binop, Exp left, Exp right)
  class MEM   (Exp exp)
  class CALL  (Exp fun, ExpList args)
  class ESEQ  (Stm stm, Exp exp)

abstract class Stm
  class MOVE  (Exp dst, Exp src)
  class EVAL  (Exp exp)             // Was called EXP
  class JUMP  (Exp exp, temp.Label target)
  class CJUMP (int rel,Exp l,Exp r, temp.Label t, temp.Label f)
  class SEQ   (Stm left, Stm right)
  class LABEL (Label label)

ExpList (Exp head, ExpList tail)
