### MiniJava Compiler
*Jason Myre - Florida Institute of Technology - 2021*

This repository shows an outline of each "phase" of my MiniJava compiler project, written primarily in Java with some C based runtime libraries.
The folder *phase09* contains the final iteration of the compiler. To test the compiler, first run the *Makefile*, then run the *compile.sh* script. A test case file *Test.java* is provided to best display the capabilities of this compiler.
