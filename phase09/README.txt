Compiler Theory Project (FINAL ITERATION)

My compiler is notably able to handle recursive calls, object allocation, inheritance, and array access.

In my test case Test.java, I demonstrate that my compiler can execute the following:

	- Recursive function calls to print fibonacci numbers 
	- Class inheritence (Setting inherited fields using inherited functions)
	- Creating objects and passing them as parameters to functions
	- Array storage and access
	- Returning arrays from functions
	- Passing arrays as function parameters

The program flow:

	- Prints fibonacci numbers up to 987
	- Sets an inherited field x to the value 6 
	- Allocates an array of size x
	- Prints array.length
	- Sets index 4 of the array to the value 11
	- Returns and prints the value at index 4

Expected output for Test.java:
	
	0
	1
	1
	2
	3
	5
	8
	13
	21
	34
	55
	89
	144
	233
	377
	610
	987
	6
	11
